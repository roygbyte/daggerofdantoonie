# Character Profile

Class: [Engineer](https://sw5e.com/characters/classes/Engineer)
> Engineers are the experts and professionals who rely on skill, bravery, and their tools to survive and keep others alive. While they do not claim to be fighters, their mere presence can turn the tide of battle or simply keep operations running.
Archetype: [Unstable Engineering](https://sw5e.com/characters/archetypes/Unstable%20Engineering)
> Those engineers who choose the Unstable Engineering discipline create and use untested combinations, resulting in powerful and often unpredictable effects.
Species: [Verpine](https://sw5e.com/characters/species/Verpine)
> Verpine culture is oriented around crafting; they are noteworthy manufacturers of weapons, shield generators, armor, as well as personal use items such as breathing apparatuses.
Background: [Holonet Technician](https://sw5e.com/characters/backgrounds/Holonet%20Technician)
> You have the codes to a distributor station which gives you access to all information sent through it. This information comes in the form of useful (and sometimes sensitive) information on a topic you choose each day to tune into; this information isnâ€™t always reliable or interesting. 

# Character Notes

## Class/Archetype

> To onlookers, it is a strange sight to behold: an engineer brooding over a machine and mumbling nonesense aboutits rusted patina or fickle logic board. But to they whose hands grease gears and cross the wires of machines otherwise deamed for the waste-shute, that special mutter of love is exactly what's needed to bring the blinking heart of technology back to life. An engineer knows machines have their own special ways of operating that can'b be determined by plans and manuals. One learns which button to press, which levers to pull, and how to "just set" a knob so that something will run. Still too, a good engineer knows that a bit of verbal encouragement can, however immeasurably so, be the difference between travelling at warpspeed, or being in the crosshairs of an imperial starship. So yes, it's a strange sight to behold. But if your life depended on swaying a stubborn holo-drive with a little sweet talk, you'd probably talk to the machines, too.

## Species

> You see a thin and scraggly looking insectoid approach the counter. The verpine's thin, twig-like frame is laden with strange apparatuses of no discernable use or function. There's what looks like a decomposed blaster attached to its forearm, an inverted satelite dish hanging from its attena, and countless other buzzing, whirling, crackling assemblages of machinery attached to the verpine. What the heck? Is that a radio-scanner? Does it even work? 

## Background

> The verpine has found itself in a comfortable life doing occasional consulting, installation, and repair contracts for the inter-governments experimental outter-rim holostations. Days pass largely without fuss or shock. Nothing's wrong with that, really. Still, the verpine dreams of a life where its clever skills and technical prowess are used to right-wrongs and settle-scores. Until the day that dream arrives, the verpine bides its time in the company of its many tools, machines, technical drawings, maps, and obscure relics from forgotten planets. The workshop undulates with the rhythmic pulsations of liquids pumping through the spidery contours of strange machines whose purpose is unknown.
